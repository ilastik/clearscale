# clearscale

`clearscale` is a small pure-Python package for clear multi-scale image metadata manipulation.

Fits in any Python environment. Works with existing code. Handles all OME-Zarr versions.

With `clearscale`, metadata runs alongside data processing, and can provide the required parameters:

```python
from clearscale import Shape, PixelSize, Unit, Scale, BlueprintShapes, Multiscale

# 1. Annotate
shape      = Shape(zip("tzyx", my_data.shape))
pixel_size = PixelSize(t=5.0, z=260.0, y=0.53, x=0.53)
unit       = Unit(t="s", z="micrometer", y="micrometer", x="micrometer")

# 2. Define scaling paradigm
scaling_blueprint = BlueprintShapes.downscale_powers_of_2_xyz(
    base_shape=shape,
    rounding="ceil",
    shape_limit=Shape(z=1, y=128, x=128),
)

# 3. Scale data according to the blueprint
for scale_key, target_shape in scaling_blueprint.items():
    scaled_data = do_my_scaling(my_data, target_shape.to_tuple())
    zarr_group.create_array(scale_key, data=scaled_data)

# 4. Expand and write metadata
base = Scale(shape, pixel_size, unit)
ms = Multiscale.from_shapes(scaling_blueprint, base=base)
zarr_group.attrs["ome"] = {
    "version": "0.6.dev3",
    "multiscales": [ms.to_ome_zarr(version="0.6.dev3")]
}
```

`clearscale` is independent of the actual data-handling packages in your environment.
For example, if you use `numpy`, `scikit-image` and `zarr`, the placeholders above could look like:

```
import os, numpy, skimage, zarr

my_data = numpy.random.rand(3, 12, 512, 512)
do_my_scaling = skimage.transform.resize
zarr_group = zarr.open_group(os.path.expanduser("~/cltest.ome.zarr"), mode="w")

# Now you can actually run the example snippet above and produce a valid `cltest.ome.zarr`
```

## Features

* Zero dependencies, runs with Python 3.10+
* Reads Neuroglancer Precomputed and OME-Zarr metadata (all versions)
* Writes OME-Zarr versions 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6.dev3
* Saves you learning about the metadata format(s)
* Helps you write expressive code
* Metadata manipulation lives alongside data manipulation
* Blueprints are as flexible as your image processing needs

## Examples

### Downsample a numpy array and save it as OME-Zarr

The first example above used a "metadata-first" approach (first compute metadata blueprint, then scale data according to it).
This example works the other way round (first scale data, then record what was done in blueprint).

```python
# This example assumes numpy, scikit-image and zarr-python 3.* are installed
import numpy as np
import zarr
from skimage.transform import pyramid_gaussian

from clearscale import BlueprintShapes, PixelSize, Scale, Shape, Unit

# 1. Generate a pyramid
image = np.random.random((128, 1024, 1024)).astype(np.float32)
pyramid = [level.astype(np.float32) for level in pyramid_gaussian(image, downscale=2)]

# 2. Write arrays to zarr on disk and record scaled shapes
group = zarr.open_group("example.ome.zarr", mode="w")
scaled_shapes = []
for i, level in enumerate(pyramid):
    scale_key = f"s{i}"
    group.create_array(scale_key, data=level)
    scaled_shapes.append(
        (
            scale_key,
            Shape(zip("zyx", level.shape))
        )
    )

# 3. Describe the full-resolution image
base = Scale(
    shape=Shape(zip("zyx", image.shape)),
    pixel_size=PixelSize(z=25, y=240, x=240),
    unit=Unit(z="micrometer", y="nanometer", x="nanometer"),
)

# 4. Use the recorded scale shapes as a blueprint to expand a Multiscale
blueprint = BlueprintShapes(scaled_shapes)
multiscale = blueprint.apply_to_scale(base)

# 5. Save OME-Zarr metadata
group.attrs["ome"] = {
    "version": "0.5",
    "multiscales": [multiscale.to_ome_zarr(version="0.5", axis_types="infer")]
}
```

### Download a single scale of a public OME-Zarr as a valid local OME-Zarr

```python
from pathlib import Path
import zarr  # This example assumes zarr-python 3.* is installed
from clearscale import Multiscale


URL = "https://s3.embl.de/i2k-2020/platy-raw.ome.zarr"
SCALE_KEY = "s6"
LOCAL_PATH = Path(f"demo-output/platy-raw-{SCALE_KEY}.ome.zarr")

# 1. Extract the raw metadata
remote_group = zarr.open_group(URL)
ome_multiscale = remote_group.attrs["multiscales"][0]

# 2. Create the local target and download the data
source_array = remote_group[SCALE_KEY]
local_group = zarr.open_group(str(LOCAL_PATH), mode="w", zarr_version=2)  # OME-Zarr v0.4 must be written in zarr v2
print(f"Downloading {SCALE_KEY} data...")
local_array = local_group.create_array(SCALE_KEY, data=source_array, overwrite=True)

# 3. Extract the correct scale metadata and upgrade it to valid independent metadata
source_multiscale = Multiscale.from_ome_zarr(ome_multiscale, shape_source=remote_group)
extracted_scale = source_multiscale[SCALE_KEY]
target_multiscale = Multiscale({SCALE_KEY: extracted_scale})

# 4. Write the new metadata to the downloaded store
local_group.attrs["multiscales"] = [target_multiscale.to_ome_zarr(version="0.4")]

# Small note: The multiscale metadata here goes to `.attrs["multiscales"]` in OME-Zarr v0.4
# (The examples above are v0.5 and v0.6, where multiscale metadata goes to `.attrs["ome"]["multiscales"]`)
```

## Why clearscale?

The motivation behind clearscale is to make upgrading from

> My tool/script does **zarr**

to

> My tool/script does **OME-Zarr**

as easy as possible.

### Why not use one of the existing libraries?

You *should* probably use one of the existing libraries, if they work for you :)

Check out the [NGFF Tools](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/resources/tools/index.html) page for some examples.
Python libraries include e.g.
[bioio](https://github.com/bioio-devs/bioio),
[ngff-zarr](https://github.com/thewtex/ngff-zarr),
[ngio](https://biovisioncenter.github.io/ngio/stable/),
[ome-zarr-py](https://github.com/ome/ome-zarr-py), and
[yaozarrs](https://github.com/tlambert03/yaozarrs).
Several of these handle not only the metadata, but also data manipulation all in one.

### Dependencies are hard

But maybe you can't, or don't want to, use any of the above.

* Technical reasons (dependency conflicts)
* Legal reasons (licensing conflicts, commercial use)
* You don't want to reimplement existing data processing with another library. 
* You just want to minimise bloat.

clearscale is tiny, dependency-free, permissively licensed, and works around your existing data processing.

### Zarr is complex enough

There are
[multiple](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python)
[backend](https://github.com/google/tensorstore)
[packages](https://github.com/constantinpape/z5)
your application or script might use for reading and writing zarr data.
Implementing efficient, chunk-wise (shard-wise) data handling is complex on its own.
You shouldn't need to learn the OME metadata specification on top to make your datasets
* accessible to others
* interoperable with other tools.

With clearscale, no matter how you handle zarr *data*, handling multiscale *metadata* like OME-Zarr looks the same.

### Custom applications

There are thousands of ways to scale or otherwise transform an image.
Maybe none of the existing libraries that can write OME-Zarr supports quite what you need.

clearscale isn't tied to data processing.
Whatever you're doing, clearscale can simplify metadata manipulation (and maybe even help catch bugs earlier).
